SETTING
*******

Game setting takes its place in a modern society, where each big company (and "Зламана кабіна" is not an exception) wants to make the best product possible. That`s why YOU, the super-experienced-alpha-beta-game-tester, have to express your professional opinion about the "Зламана кабіна"'s new game for students - 'Guess That Number!'. What's gonna happen, will the game even start, won't your PC die after all? You really want to know that?! Then open game.py file through your terminal (yeah, like in OLD GOOD TIMES!) and let the journey begin !!!

****
PLOT
****

You are just a person who found this game by chance...
You read about "Зламана кабіна" team before, but never thought that you will have a chance to test a young developers' product...
You returned home after a hard day at work and just want to relax, sitting on the sofa and reading your favorite (Douglas Adams's) book...
But your feeling of distraction doesn't let you focus on reading 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy', so you manage to turn your PC on...
No one knows how the game opened... 
Maybe you just started it via the terminal, because after many years of programming you don't even realise whether you are typing on keyboard or no...
Hmm...
Interesting image there, the part of an old car, what could that mean...
You press the start button...
/// After long hours of playing ///
What was that? How did my computer break?!...
Suddenly, watching on the monitor you remembered that you had pressed a button...
Well, it can't be true, three young boys couldn't have broken my PC...
Old combination of CTRL+ALT+T raises the terminal on your screen and you see everything returning on their places...
Just a photo...
Just a joke...
You remember you being a kid and starting to write some simple code on Pascal years and years ago as a small tear slowly falls from your eye...
You definetely won't forget this game...

********
SCENARIO
********

As you realised the necessity to open the file, you notice that game is not so perfect, you think that you could have changed some details, made some more options and so on. But then you realise that the team of three young developers didn't have so much time to do all of that, although they surely will improve their skills and maybe become new Ukrainian well-known devs, who knows..
You start to learn new numbers and opened the whole new world of different types of numbers that you hadn't known about before! Ulam numbers, Happy, Primes.. Oh my, you played for hours in this game and learned so much new that now you can tell about the game to everyone.. BUT WAIT! What is that button in the right corner of the screen..? It says 'DO NOT PRESS THIS!'.. Maybe there is a reason? Pff, you are not one of those coward. You PRESS it and...
