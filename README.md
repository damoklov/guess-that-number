# Guess that number
'Guess That Number' is a game, created by the "Зламана Кабіна" team in order to take part in University competition between teams of students.
Game itself was made aiming for teaching different kinds of numbers - Ulam's, Happy and Prime numbers.

/// UPD 19.10.2018: Our team decided to place the project on GitHub for further developing.
